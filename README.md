# bgee_coexpression
Translator CQ 1.6  redone with BGEE data

The `README.profile_merge_4` in directory `TissueBin` is where this ended up.

Overall the experiment was all v.s all gene expression in ~300 tissue 
where the 300 tissues are reduced to about 200 tissues with manual 
collapsing of ontologicaly related terms.

addtional effort was expended speeding the task up by about 50 times(on laptop).
